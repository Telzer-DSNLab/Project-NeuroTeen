# Project_NeuroTeen

This repository contains all stimuli, scripts, behavioral and fMRI tasks used in Project NeuroTeen.

Project NeuroTeen is a 5-year longitudinal fMRI study grant awarded by NIDA to Dr. Eva Telzer. The grant is entitled, Incorporating the Social Context Into Neurocognitive Models of Adolescent Risk Taking. The overall goal of the study is to examine how three important social influences – family, peers, and authority – all differentially contribute to neurocognitive development and risk taking behavior, prosociality, social reward, and neural encoding of social network position. 

See Document entitlied, "NeuroTeen Wave 2 Study Summary" for extensive detail on this project.
