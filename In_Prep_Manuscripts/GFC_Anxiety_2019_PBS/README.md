This folder contain all code and info on a study in prep which estimates how facets of intrinsic connectivity can predict two distinct types of anxiety in adolescence both cross-sectionally and longitudinally. This project comes from the Telzer lab NeuroTeen project (see Parent Folder for description of the longitudinal neuroimaging study).

The present study used a cutting edge method called "General Functional Connectivity" to generate more reliable estimates of intrinsic connectivity based upon Elliott et al., (2019) See here: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053811919300746?via%3Dihub
